Hello and Welcome to my game Steermaster!

This is a simple game where you controll a car through 3 levels made in python with pygame.
If you wnat to see the how the game works you can go to the [Portfolio](Portfolio/README-Portfolio.md)

HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Clone the folder Steermaster-Game
2. Install Pygame (pip install pygame)
3. Run this command _python3 Steermaster-Game/script/steermaster.py_ so the path to the assets works
4. Play the game and enjoy!


Also I was bored and made a little calculation on how much time It will take to randomly code the game
-> [Fun Calculation](how-much-time-to-randomly-code)
