I was bored and made calculations to see how difficult it would be to type the code reandomly so i came out with the following solution:

Even if someone filled the entire universe full of monkeys and typewriters and made them type at 100 words per minute, if you let those monkeys type for the lifespan of a universe, it would take an astronomically huge number of universes for some monkey, in some universe, at some specific time, to type out by sheer luck the code that makes up my game (which is approximately 3,000 lines).

The number of universes is approximately 10^164540. This number is so huge it cannot be easily comprehended. Now, I am going to try to help you grasp the insanity of this number. 

Imagine our universe. Inside our universe, there are 10^80 atoms. Now, imagine that every single atom was another universe. Then, do that again, so that every atom in the 10^80 universes is another universe. If you kept repeating this process 2,054 more times (there for 2056 layers), the number of universes you would get would need to be filled to the brim with monkeys and typewriters. Only by the time all these universes live and die, following the big-bang–big-crunch theory, would it be expected for one monkey to type out the entire code of Steermaster.
